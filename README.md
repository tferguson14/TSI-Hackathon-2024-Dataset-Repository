# Hack 4 Good: Tech for Social Impact Sample Datasets

![Hack 4 Good: Tech for Social Impact Sample Datasets](/images/hack4good_banner.png "Welcome to the Tech for Social Impact Hackathon")

## Overview

This repository serves as a resource hub for the Hack 4 Good hackathon, focusing on applying technology to foster social impact across various sectors. Below you will find a list of use cases that our hackathon aims to address, along with examples of publicly available datasets that could be used to tackle these challenges.

### Hackathon Use Cases

#### Humanitarian Care/Help
- **Goal**: Improve volunteer alignment with humanitarian efforts through a mobile app.
- **Example Datasets**:
  - Global Volunteer Database
  - Real-time Disaster Response Records

#### Sustainability
- **Goal**: Create dashboards to monitor environmental impact.
- **Example Datasets**:
  - Global Forest Watch
  - Water Quality Monitoring Data

... *Add the other use cases following the same format* ...

### Sources for Publicly Available Datasets

Remember to replace the placeholder links and text with actual information and resources. The Python snippet for using Bing AI would need to be actual functional code. If Bing AI has an API or SDK that can be used for generating synthetic datasets, you would include that code there.

For the banner image at the top of the README, make sure you have uploaded the actual image to the `/images` folder in your repository, and reference it using the correct path. If you need help generating this banner image or writing the Bing AI Python code snippet, please let me know!
